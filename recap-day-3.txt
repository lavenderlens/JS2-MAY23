Arrays-

    - for loop
    - for of 
    - forEach (skips empty elements)

    - for in (returns keys)
    - Object.keys() - same as above
    - Object.values() 
    - Object.entries() - 2D array
    - functional arrays to come this morning

Scope-

    - the scope chain from child to parent to grandparent etc
    - hoisting (only occurs with var so hardly ever see it)
    - block-scoped let and const (review)
    - closures - lexically-scoped variable(s) and a returned functional
        - this is the underlying mechanism for giving functions state
        - exploited in React hooks
    - different contexts of "this"
        - bind()
        - IIFE
        - arrow function
            - arrow functions DO NOT HAVE a context of "this"
            - which makes them suited to use where the parent context is desired

ES6 - various, to be continued
